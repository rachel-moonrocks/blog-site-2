Time sure flies when you're writing code. Or should it be *when you're compiling code*? One thing's for certain: it doesn't fly when you're running specs. That seems to make time move backwards! 
So if you're wondering about the gap between blog entries, just imagine I've been running specs this whole time.)

Hello there, and welcome back! My name is Rachel, and I'm thrilled to return to this space.

It's a bit surreal yet oddly comforting to revisit my "old blog site," which I created when I was first trying to break into the world of software engineering. Fresh out of a coding bootcamp—back when the bootcamp market wasn't quite so saturated—I found solace in writing out my thoughts and immersing myself in the blogs of others.

Back then, I was drinking straight from the firehose. With so many new concepts swirling around—relational databases, HTML & CSS, DOM manipulation, web architecture, algorithms, and more—I wanted to learn it all and make sure I didn't forget a thing.

Fast forward seven years, and that hunger for learning hasn’t diminished. If anything, it’s grown. I’m always looking to expand my knowledge and maintain a record of lessons learned along the way. In my day-to-day work as a software engineer, this often translates to writing internal documentation for manual processes or complex code, drafting CURL requests and example code for product and support teams, creating sequence diagrams and flowcharts, commenting code for documentation tools, and collaborating with others.

I’ve realized that one of the biggest bottlenecks in my workflow is having to pause and rediscover how to do something I’ve already done. Worse yet, it’s trying to assist someone who’s stuck because they lack the proper setup or instructions. By creating thorough documentation, I’ve not only streamlined my own work but also reduced future stress and made onboarding or collaboration smoother for others.

So here I am, back to blogging, eager to share my journey, insights, and lessons learned. Let’s see where this new chapter takes us.
